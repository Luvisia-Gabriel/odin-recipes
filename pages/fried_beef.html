    <h1>Fried Beef Recipe</h1>

    <img src="../images/beef_fries.jpg" alt="Fried meat with fries">

    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe is for a flavorful and slightly spicy Korean beef dish called <strong>Bulgogi.</strong> Traditionally made with thinly sliced beef, it offers a delightful contrast between tender meat and a savory, slightly sweet marinade.
            The marinade combines the umami richness of soy sauce with the sweetness of brown sugar, the nuttiness of sesame oil, and the tang of rice vinegar. A kick of spice comes from Korean gochujang paste, 
            but you can adjust the amount to suit your preference. The marinated beef is pan-fried to juicy perfection, optionally coated in a quick reduction of the leftover marinade for extra flavor. 
            Garnished with green onions and sesame seeds, this Korean Fried Beef makes a satisfying main course served over rice with kimchi or other pickled vegetables on the side.</p>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> <strong> Marinate the Beef:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the soy sauce, brown sugar, sesame oil, rice vinegar, garlic, ginger, gochujang paste, black pepper, and onion powder.
             Add the sliced beef and toss to coat evenly. Cover the bowl and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes, or up to overnight for deeper flavor.</li>

        <li><strong> Heat Oil:</strong> Heat a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add enough vegetable oil to coat the bottom of the pan.</li>
            
        <li><strong> Cook the Beef: </strong> Once the oil is hot and shimmering, add the marinated beef (reserve the marinade for later).  Don't overcrowd the pan, cook the beef in batches if necessary. 
            Sear the beef for 2-3 minutes per side, or until cooked through to your desired doneness. Remove the cooked beef from the pan and set aside on a plate.</li>
            
        <li><strong>Reduce the Marinade (Optional):</strong> If you want a thicker sauce, you can reduce the leftover marinade in the pan. Pour the reserved marinade into the pan and bring it to a simmer.
             Scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Simmer for a few minutes until the sauce thickens slightly.</li>
            
        <li><strong>Assemble and Serve:</strong> Return the cooked beef to the pan with the reduced marinade (if using). Toss to coat the beef in the sauce.
             Garnish with sliced green onion and sesame seeds. Serve hot over rice with your favorite side dishes like kimchi or pickled vegetables.</li>

    <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Good old-fashioned recipes evoke a sense of nostalgia and home-cooked comfort. 
           They often feature simple, wholesome ingredients, classic techniques, and flavors
           that have stood the test of time. These recipes are typically passed down through
           generations, cherished for their ability to create hearty and satisfying meals. 
           Think slow-cooked pot roasts, hearty stews, homemade pies, and classic cakesâ€”dishes 
           that warm the soul and bring people together.</p>

     <h2>Ingredients</h2>  
         <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 Cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 1/2 Teaspons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon salt</li>
            <li>1 1/4 Cups buttermilk</li>
            <li>3 Tablespoon butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>Vanilla extract (1 teaspoon) for added flavour</li>
         </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>    
         <ol>
            <li><strong>Dry Ingredients: </strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, 
                baking powder, sugar, and salt.</li>
            <li><strong>Combine Wet Ingredients: </strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, 
                melted butter, egg, and vanilla extract (if using).</li> 
            <li><strong> Wet and Dry Ingredients: </strong></strong> Gradually add the wet ingredients to the 
                dry ingredients, whisking until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, 
                as this can lead to tough pancakes.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook the Pancakes:</strong>  Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium heat. 
                Pour or scoop the batter onto the hot griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for 
                each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface and the edges are golden 
                brown, then flip and cook until golden brown on the other side.</li>   
            <li><strong> Serve: </strong>Serve immediately with your favorite toppings, such as butter, 
                maple syrup, whipped cream, or fresh fruit.</li>         
        </ol>
